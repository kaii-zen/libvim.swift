# libvim.swift

libvim.swift is a Swift package that provides a wrapper around [libvim](https://github.com/onivim/libvim): the core Vim editing engine implemented as a minimal C library.
Note that the current scope of this is limited to hiding away C types and pointer interaction; that is, the API itself is more or less identical to the C API provided by libvim (i.e., it is not "Swifty").

## Features (section generated by ChatGPT ðŸ™ƒ)

- **Integration**: Easily integrate Vim functionalities into your Swift applications.
- **Customization**: Customize Vim behaviors according to your application's needs.
- **Efficiency**: Leverage the powerful text editing capabilities of Vim within your Swift codebase.

## Installation

You can install `libvim.swift` using [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/).

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/kaii-zen/libvim.swift", from: "0.0.1")
]
```

## Usage

```swift
import libvim

// Example usage
vimInit()
vimInput("i")
vimInput("H")
vimInput("e")
vimInput("l")
vimInput("l")
vimInput("o")
vimInput(",")
vimInput(" ")
vimInput("W")
vimInput("o")
vimInput("r")
vimInput("l")
vimInput("d")
vimInput("!")
vimKey("<esc>")

print(vimBufferGetLine(vimBufferGetCurrent, 1)) // -> Hello, World!
```

For more rudimentary examples have a look at the [tests](Tests/libvimTests).
For a basic UIKit example, see [Example/](Example).

## Requirements

- Swift 5.10+
- macOS 14+
- An Apple Silicon Mac

(there is probably no real reason for this, it's just the versions I started with)
